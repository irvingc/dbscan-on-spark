# DBSCAN on Spark

### Overview

This is an implementation of the [DBSCAN clustering algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) 
on top of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). It is loosely based on the paper from He, Yaobin, et al.
["MR-DBSCAN: a scalable MapReduce-based DBSCAN algorithm for heavily skewed data"](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yaobin_He/publication/260523383_MR-DBSCAN_a_scalable_MapReduce-based_DBSCAN_algorithm_for_heavily_skewed_data/links/0046353a1763ee2bdf000000.pdf). 


I have also created a [visual guide](http://www.irvingc.com/visualizing-dbscan) that explains how the algorithm works.
### Current vesion of DBSCAN is dbscan-on-spark_2.10:0.2.0-SNAPSHOT
Be aware that current version of DBSCAN in this repo  is  :
	<groupId>com.irvingc.spark</groupId>
	<artifactId>**dbscan-on-spark_2.10**</artifactId>
	<version>**0.2.0-SNAPSHOT**</version>
It is not present in any  official repository and to make it work, you need to build it yourself.
### Getting DBSCAN on Spark

Version 0.1.0 of DBSCAN on Spark is published to [bintray](https://bintray.com/). If you use SBT you
can include SBT in your application adding the following to your build.sbt:

```
resolvers += "bintray/irvingc" at "http://dl.bintray.com/irvingc/maven"

libraryDependencies += "com.irvingc.spark" %% "dbscan" % "0.1.0"
```



If you use Maven or Ivy you can use a similar resolver, but you just
need to account for the scala version (the example is for Scala 2.10):

```
...

	<repositories>
		<repository>
			<id>dbscan-on-spark-repo</id>
			<name>Repo for DBSCAN on Spark</name>
			<url>http://dl.bintray.com/irvingc/maven</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
...

	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.irvingc.spark</groupId>
		<artifactId>dbscan_2.10</artifactId>
		<version>0.1.0</version>
	</dependency>


```
DBSCAN on Spark is built against Scala 2.10.


### Example usage 


I have created a [sample project](https://github.com/irvingc/dbscan-on-spark-example) 
showing how DBSCAN on Spark can be used. The following however should give you a
good idea of how it should be included in your application.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.dbscan.DBSCAN

object DBSCANSample {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("DBSCAN Sample")
    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)

    val data = sc.textFile(src)

    val parsedData = data.map(s => Vectors.dense(s.split(',').map(_.toDouble))).cache()

    log.info(s"EPS: $eps minPoints: $minPoints")

    val model = DBSCAN.train(
      parsedData,
      eps = eps,
      minPoints = minPoints,
      maxPointsPerPartition = maxPointsPerPartition)

    model.labeledPoints.map(p =>  s"${p.x},${p.y},${p.cluster}").saveAsTextFile(dest)

    sc.stop()
  }
}
```
